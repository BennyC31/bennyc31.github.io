This challenge uses HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create dashboard based on the WeatherPy challenge.

## Notes
* I used all the content provided.
* If content was not provided I added my own content.
* I commented out the @media queries because I didn't like the look of having no menus with a smaller screen.  The meta viewport tags in the <head> section handle the screen layout for all sizes.

## Bonus
Not enough time, but I may revisit and some bonus content.
